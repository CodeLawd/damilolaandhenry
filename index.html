                            Two of you make a really cute team, you compliment
                            each other while making it fun, that’s very rare. I

                            point and further because my brother introduced you
                            to the Squad by singing your praises and putting you
                            on the highest of mountains. We can all see the
                            value you bring to his life(I and Tim really thank
                            you for this 😉). It doesn’t matter if the guy is
                            perfect or the girl is perfect, as long as they are
                            perfect for each other. So, In the Wise words of
                            Bill and Ted - Be excellent to each other.

                            Your love story to me is a dream come true for me,
                            because I know how many times, I had to pray for you
                            to get a man that will truly Love you for you. This
                            I know you never knew not until now, I even picked
                            up fast for you Every month😂 For the bride to be I
                            know you to be someone who have had a little bit of
                            ups and down in life and with love but I say that
                            which you have with Henry is the best love story I
                            know and part of the good thing that comes with
                            waiting. I can not but imagine what you have gone
                            through as touching relationship issues and life in
                            general but you still remain strong and dogged.
                            Henry is a lucky guy to have someone as good as you
                            and I know you also are lucky to have him around
                            you. When I spoke with him for the first time I
                            could sense this is the right person for Dami I pray
                            for you guys that your love remains stronger and
                            also that you both wake up each day been grateful to
                            God that you have each other. Love you Dearies

                          <p>
                            The journey of getting to know Abikure Henry and
                            Ogunfowora Damilola started back then in 2015 during
                            NYSC days at Ezionum in Delta State. On getting to
                            my PPA that day, Henry was one of the 3 to come
                            welcome me that day. He’s so welcoming and very
                            friendly, was part of the reason I stayed in the
                            community, because he’s a foreign student and I was
                            like someone that came as a foreign student to stay
                            in a place like that to serve, then I have no excuse
                            at all. I met with Damilola when we had our first
                            fellowship meeting, she’s so friendly, among the
                            female Corps member I met, she’s one those that is
                            very easy to relate with, she’s always acting like a
                            caution to us, telling us about the community and
                            all, as she was like a Batch before us. To speak of
                            the experience with them, Henry was my personal
                            fitness trainer then, we went through workouts and
                            jogging together. He also set me on tech so much.
                            Talking about both of them back then, I started to
                            notice the way both play with each other, always
                            tackling each other on any issue and tends to
                            correct each other when they’re doing something
                            wrong, then I know they have feelings for each
                            other. And I was so glad when I was told they
                            started dating and they’re about to get married.

                            Damie, like I fondly call her has impressed her
                            endearing self in my life in several undeniable
                            ways. There are no 'wow' stories about how I met her
                            but each day and experience with her counts for a
                            greater 'Wow!!!'. One of the beautiful things about
                            her is the fact that she is Damie, anytime anywhere
                            and anyday; no facades. With this, it was quite easy
                            for me to love her. Of course, the fact that we can
                            pray in tongues together makes some moments with
                            Damie so memorable. I met Henry through Damie, and I
                            am grateful to God that what started some years ago
                            is about to be consummated in a Holy Matrimony. I
                            know Henry as the calm, intelligent and tech-savvy
                            guy. Easy to talk with, kind and loving. I see the
                            way he treats Damie and I know she couldn't have
                            asked for more. I am happy for the decision both of
                            then have made and I am also glad to share in their
                            ceremony.

                            Henry Emamoke Abikure was in love I almost fell over
                            laughing. Henry! Henry Abikure....in love....
                            someone pinch me. The same man I lived and grew up
                            with for 5 years who for all his great attributes is
                            also a torment in his own right is said to be in
                            love. i called the only person I knew could
                            understand (his main G David) to confirm and voila
                            the story was true. Truly anything is possible in
                            naija!. putting aside my teasing, on meeting the
                            person who had done the impossible and tamed Mr.
                            Abikure i could understand why and see why Henry
                            could shout to the roof top that he had found love.
                            Damilola is really his missing rib, they fit
                            together like puzzle pieces giving you a view of a
                            masterpiece. Near or from afar you know or can see
                            that they genuinely love each other. Hence, 'waffi
                            no dey carry last' Henry got down on that knee and
                            engaged her sharply!...which is a story for another
                            day. But I digress, my point is that I’m excited for
                            this union, it is wonderful thing and wish them both
                            all the best and their hearts' desires on this
                            incredible journey. I celebrate with you and
                            congratulate you, May you keep God at the top and
                            center of your new home. Most importantly I cant
                            thank Dami enough for rescuing Henry lool. Please
